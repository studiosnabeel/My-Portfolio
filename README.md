## Getting Started 

To get started with this portfolio website, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/studiosnabeel/My-Portfolio.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd My-Portfolio

3. Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser to view the website.

### Deployment

To deploy your portfolio website on Netlify.com, follow these steps:

- Create a Netlify Account: If you don't have a Netlify account already, visit the Netlify website and sign up for a free account.

- Connect your GitHub Repository: In your Netlify account, click on "New site from Git" and choose GitHub as your Git provider. Select the repository you want to deploy.

- Configure Build Settings: Once your repository is connected, you'll need to configure the build settings. Set the branch you want to deploy and specify the build command, such as npm run build or yarn build.

- Set Environment Variables (if necessary): If your website requires environment variables, you can set them in the Netlify dashboard. This is useful for sensitive information like API keys or configuration settings.

- Review Deployment Settings: Review the deployment settings and make any necessary changes, such as custom domain configuration or branch deploys.

- Deploy your Website: Click on the "Deploy site" button, and Netlify will initiate the build process. You can track the progress in the deployment logs.

- Monitor Deployment: Once the build is complete, Netlify will provide you with a unique URL for your deployed website. You can access and preview your site from this URL.

- Custom Domain (Optional): If you have a custom domain, you can configure it in the Netlify settings. This will allow your website to be accessible via your own domain name.

- Continuous Deployment (Optional): Netlify provides continuous deployment, which means that whenever you push changes to your connected GitHub repository, Netlify will automatically rebuild and deploy your website.
